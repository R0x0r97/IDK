### Introduction
Machine Learning is "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." <cite> - Arthur Samuel</cite>
Machine Learning has a vast number of application in a number of fields, from computer science all the way to the medical field.
This project focuses on one specific application: image recognition.

### The purpose of the project
The aim of this project is to recognize handwritten digits (drawn via a mouse on a canvas).
### The stakeholders
This project is aimed towards 
### System requirements
- RAM: at least 200 MB
- CPU: any CPU made after the year 2000
### Theoretical background
The machine learning model used for this project is: **logistic regression**. The reason why this model was used is because the given application requires classification.
